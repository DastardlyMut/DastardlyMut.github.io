career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
      I am a dedicated developer and always eager to learn. I love meeting and working with new people as well as engaging with new and interesting technologies. 
      My expertise is in audio development, sound engineering as well as sound design for a variety of platforms. If I'm not skateboarding or making noise with synths, you'll find me creating little program doodles in MaxMSP or Reaper's JSFx. I love being in the outdoors recording ambience or flying my drone around.

        tagline: Standard Bank Ovation award winning immersive installation with Lexi Meier
        info: Managed the production of both audio and visual content for fine artist Heidi Sincuba’s art installation, entitled ‘Exploitation’. This took place at the 2018 National Arts Festival. My involvement included work for the pre- to post-production of the digital media, as well as installing the exhibition’s 18 channel sound system and visual projection. This work made use of the ImmerGO sound system which I have been involved in developing with miniDSP.

        tagline: Audio engineering for Justin Shaw's art graduate final piece
        info: Built the automated control system that was fed input data from facebook graph api. This data was then used to control Resolume, Ableton and a printer. The concept had users interacting with a facebook live stream of the exhibition space. These would then trigger various controls that would affect the live stream video and a Louville laser within the space.

      The publications below include my masters thesis and peer-reviewed papers that I have contributed

    thesis:
      - title: "An Investigation into the Application of Distributed Endpoint Processing to 3D Immersive Audio Rendering"
      - abstract: 3D immersive audio rendering systems use algorithms that accurately render the perceived location of an audio source within a space using multiple sets of loudspeakers. The algorithms used by these renderers can become very processor intensive as the number of tracks and loudspeakers being used increases. The ImmerGo spatial audio system provides a solution to this by using distributed endpoint processing. Immergo uses a client-server architecture that control multiple smaller endpoints distributed on an Ethernet Audio Video Bridging (AVB) network. Each endpoint contains an audio mixer which is dedicated to mixing audio to a smaller subset of speakers according to commands from ImmerGo.
                  The ImmerGo system performs its rendering calculations within the host computer and then mixes the audio at each endpoint. The work in this thesis identified that the processing load put on the host computer due to these calculations may be mitigated by offloading the rendering algorithm calculations to the endpoints as well. In order to prove this for a number of different algorithms, the ImmerGo system was modified to include three new algorithms as well as the one it currently uses. Each algorithm then had its processing offloaded to the endpoints at three successive steps of distribution. Tests were performed to determine the limitations of each step, and how the host processor and endpoint processors were affected by distributing the calculations. Listening tests were also performed to ensure that each newly introduced algorithm was implemented correctly.
